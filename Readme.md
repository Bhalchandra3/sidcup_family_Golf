The dets event object, in your provided code, is a parameter passed to the anonymous function that serves as an event handler for the "mousemove" event. This object contains various properties and information related to the mouse movement event. While "dets" is not a standard or built-in name for an event object in JavaScript, it appears to be a shorthand or abbreviation you've used. Typically, you'll see it as "event" or "e" in event handler functions, but you can name it as you like.

Here are some common properties of a mouse event object:

1. `event.clientX` and `event.clientY`: These properties represent the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the client area of the browser window. They tell you where the mouse pointer is within the viewport.

2. `event.pageX` and `event.pageY`: These properties represent the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the entire document. They tell you where the mouse pointer is within the entire page.

3. `event.target`: This property references the HTML element over which the mouse event occurred. It can be useful for determining which element triggered the event.

4. `event.type`: This property indicates the type of event, which in this case, would be "mousemove."

5. `event.timestamp`: This property provides a timestamp indicating when the event occurred.

6. `event.which` or `event.buttons`: These properties can tell you which mouse button or buttons are pressed during the event (e.g., left, right, or middle button).

7. `event.preventDefault()`: A method that can be used to prevent the default behavior of the mouse event, such as preventing a click or drag operation.

8. `event.stopPropagation()`: A method that stops the event from propagating further up or down the DOM tree, preventing other event handlers from executing.
